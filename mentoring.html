      <h2>Why mentoring?</h2>
      <p>Mentoring is about more than giving advice, it's about motivating and empowering and helping the other person
        understand themselves and their aims – and how they can get there. It's also about helping each other resolve
        issues, whether directly or more often through advice and sharing experiences.</p>
      <p>
        We invite women from all around the globe to join a vibrant community, find support and encouragement for the
        journey in tech, and to build an inclusive and visionary future for the industry.</p>
      <h3>What Makes A Good Mentor?</h3>
      <p>A good mentor needs to be more than just a successful individual. A good mentor must have the disposition and
        desire to develop other people. It requires a willingness to reflect on and share one’s own experiences,
        including one’s failures. Great mentors must be able to both “talk the talk” and “walk the walk.”</p>
      <h3>What Makes A Good Mentee?</h3>
      <p>Just as there are specific characteristics of a successful mentor, there are attributes and sensibilities that
        make for a good mentee. This is important, because mentees must remember that mentors are doing this from the
        goodness of their heart, so being a good mentee is the best way to ensure the relationship enjoys a healthy
        purposeful existence.</p>
      <h3>The Mentoring Relationship</h3>
      <p>A mentoring relationship must be managed and nurtured. It is a joint venture that requires both parties to
        actively attend to its care and feeding. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="flex">

        MAIN FLOW OF THE PROGRAM:</h2>
        <p>The program is pro-bono, meaning that it does not involve any kind of payments neither from mentors nor from mentees. What else do you need to know?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s a year-round program and you can apply whenever you want.</li>
          <li>All the sessions within the program are pro-bono both for mentors and for mentees.</li>
          <li>Both mentors and mentees apply for the Global Mentoring Program via filling applications on this website.
            If we receive an application by the 25th of each month, our selection committee should be able to process it by the beginning of the next month. For example, if you applied on November 20, you might hear from us already in December.
          </li>
          <li>Any mentee can book a session with any mentor, we do not match particular mentees for each mentor, however the number of sessions is limited by the time slots the mentor provided and by 3 sessions for 3 months that each of the mentees will have promo code for.</li>
          <li>Each mentor selected for the program will be able to create a profile on our partner’s planform Introwise. The platform allows mentors to provide time-slots when they are available for mentoring sessions. As soon as any of the mentees books a session, the mentor will receive an email from Introwise platform with a calendar event and link to the call.</li>
          <li>Each mentee selected for the program will receive a promo code for 3 Introwise mentor-sessions, that will be active for 3 months. After the 3-month period you will be asked if you want to continue participating and the promo code might be upgraded.</li>
        </ul>
