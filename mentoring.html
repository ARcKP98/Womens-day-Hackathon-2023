    <h2>Why mentoring?</h2>
    <p>Mentoring is about more than giving advice, it's about motivating and empowering and helping the other person
      understand themselves and their aims – and how they can get there. It's also about helping each other resolve
      issues, whether directly or more often through advice and sharing experiences.</p>
    <p>
      We invite women from all around the globe to join a vibrant community, find support and encouragement for the
      journey in tech, and to build an inclusive and visionary future for the industry.</p>
      <h3>What Makes A Good Mentor?</h3>
      <p>A good mentor needs to be more than just a successful individual. A good mentor must have the disposition and desire to develop other people. It requires a willingness to reflect on and share one’s own experiences, including one’s failures. Great mentors must be able to both “talk the talk” and “walk the walk.”</p>
      <h3>What Makes A Good Mentee?</h3>
      <p>Just as there are specific characteristics of a successful mentor, there are attributes and sensibilities that make for a good mentee. This is important, because mentees must remember that mentors are doing this from the goodness of their heart, so being a good mentee is the best way to ensure the relationship enjoys a healthy purposeful existence.</p>
      <h3>The Mentoring Relationship</h3>
      <p>A mentoring relationship must be managed and nurtured. It is a joint venture that requires both parties to actively attend to its care and feeding. </p>
