      <h3>Rosangela, 34 years old</h3>
      <p>"I started learning how to code after having my first child. 
        It turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. 
        With my newfound skills, I founded a successful start-up that helps businesses grow and thrive. 
        I hope to inspire others to pursue their passions in technology and show them that it's never 
        too late to learn something new."</p>
