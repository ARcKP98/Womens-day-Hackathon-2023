# History
At Femme Tech, we believe in celebrating the achievements of women in tech, both past and present. History may seem boring, but the stories of superwomen like Ada Lovelace and Annie Easley are anything but. Lovelace was the world's first computer programmer, while Easley was a groundbreaker for gender and racial diversity in the field. Our page is dedicated to educating and inspiring our users with the amazing contributions of women in tech, and reminding them of the endless possibilities for their own future in the industry.

### Become a mentor
Our mentoring program features a comprehensive form with form validation, designed to gather important personal information and skill sets from potential mentors.

### Become a mentee
The mentee program is another alternative. Not all people ahve a big skills set, but could still be a very valuable mentee and have the right passion and motivation. This form is of similar structure as to the mentor form. User will need to added personal details but some skills, although skills are not required. 

Our mentee program offers an alternative option for individuals who may not have an extensive skill set, but possess the passion and motivation to succeed in the tech industry. Our mentee form follows a similar structure to our mentor form, requiring personal details but not necessarily specific skills. We believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and grow, and our mentee program is designed to help women in tech do just that.

# Donating
Our modern world isn't so modern for some. We aimed to broaden the user's understanding of how vital it is to extend beyond our own communities and consider the needs of women in other areas. In today's world, numerous challenges persist, which may not seem as contemporary to some. Thus, we incorporated a donations section, where users can learn about two non-profit organizations that offer significant assistance to women living in underprivileged communities. These organizations operate in regions where corruption, war, disease, and governmental control have hindered women from receiving adequate education or pursuing a better life and career. 

![](assets/readme.doc/donations%20page%20image.png)

Click on any of two links and the user will be directed to a donations website.

###	404 page 

The website has been implemented with type of error in order to allow users to be able to understand when they navigate to a broken link. 

On the 404 page a home button has been implemented in order to allow users to be able to return home without using the back arrow button.



##	Features

A favicon has been implemented with women coding to symbolize the meaning of the page and at the same time to allow users to easily identify this website if they have multiple tabs open.

![png-transparent-laptop-girl-thinking-woman-electronics-hand-computer-thumbnail-removebg-preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96884287/226112480-61705667-2629-446c-a361-7e3338fea014.png)


At the same time, the title has been selected to offer a clear description of the page where the user is navigating, such as Home, About, History, Contact Us, Mentoring and Donate page.



# Wireframes

The wireframes have been created in order to allow the members of the team to have an overview of what the website will look like or a simple vision to guide us to completion of the website.

However, the website frameworks have not really been followed as we decided to implement a more simplicity for the pages so that users will find it more easily to familiarise with the webpage.

# Testing

### Validation checks

All pages underwent validation checks to ensure that every line of code was scrutinized for syntax errors, including missing delimiters or other necessary parameters. Syntax errors such as open tags, misspellings, and forgotten quotation marks, colons, or equal signs may still render a web page, but the resulting output may differ from the designer's original intent due to malfunctioning tags or elements.

In essence, an HTML validator verifies whether a web page's HTML and CSS codes adhere to the standards established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
