# Femme in tech..

The term "women/femme in tech" describes the presence and involvement of women in the technology industry. 

Celebrating women in tech involves acknowledging their achievements and contributions to the field, as well as supporting initiatives that encourage more women to pursue careers in technology. 

This promotes the development of the next generation of female tech leaders and fosters a more diverse and inclusive industry.

w3schools for back to top button
Used Bootstrap documentation for reference
Issues: 
Making the button work. Button would not display. and the function would not execute properly. Solution: Make sure js file was at the bottom of the body. Also override boostrap css by specifying class. Remove duplicated content. 
Defualt bootstrap styling was not being overridden for highlight. Solution: Use inline styling.

On the 404 page a home button has been implemented in order to allow users to be able to return home without using the back arrow button.

## Wireframes

The wireframes have been created in order to allow the members of the team to have an overview of what the website will look like or a simple vision to guide us to completion of the website.

However, the website frameworks have not really been followed as we decided to implement a more simplicity for the pages so that users will find it more easily to familiarise with the webpage.
