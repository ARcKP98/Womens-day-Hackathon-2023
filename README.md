Used Bootstrap documentation for reference
Issues: 
Making the button work. Button would not display. and the function would not execute properly. Solution: Make sure js file was at the bottom of the body. Also override boostrap css by specifying class. Remove duplicated content. 
Defualt bootstrap styling was not being overridden for highlight. Solution: Use inline styling.

3. History
At Femme Tech, we believe in celebrating the achievements of women in tech, both past and present. History may seem boring, but the stories of superwomen like Ada Lovelace and Annie Easley are anything but. Lovelace was the world's first computer programmer, while Easley was a groundbreaker for gender and racial diversity in the field. Our page is dedicated to educating and inspiring our users with the amazing contributions of women in tech, and reminding them of the endless possibilities for their own future in the industry.

At the same time, the title has been selected to offer a clear description of the page where the user is navigating, such as Home, About, History, Contact Us, Mentoring and Donate page.



## Wireframes

The wireframes have been created in order to allow the members of the team to have an overview of what the website will look like or a simple vision to guide us to completion of the website.

However, the website frameworks have not really been followed as we decided to implement a more simplicity for the pages so that users will find it more easily to familiarise with the webpage.
