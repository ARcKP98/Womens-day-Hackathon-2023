        <p>short intro needed</p>
    
        <!-- kept the body of the time line seprate change if you need to for styling-->
        <section> where i'm putting the top 5 women in tech for now 
            <!-- I think we need a title here eg where it started -->
            <h2>Where It Began</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
                <p>Was a 19th-century mathematician who was the world's first computer programmer. 
                    She wrote the first algorithm designed to be processed by a machine and published it in 1843. 
                    She is celebrated today as a pioneering figure in computer science and a role model for women in Tech. 
                    She even has an Ada Lovelace Day designated as the second Tuesday of October.</p>

                <h3>Hedy Lamar</h3>
                <p>Was an Austrian-born actress and inventor, during World War II in 1941, she and co-inventor, Goerge Antheil, 
                    developed a frequency-hopping system. Originally intended to help guide torpedos without being detected by the enemy. 
                    It took decades for her revolutionary technology to be fully embraced, but it's inspired the WiFi, Bluetooth and Gps technologies we use today.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Grace Hopper</h3>
                <p>Was a trailblazer in computer science and a pioneer in the development of modern technology. 
                    She was also the first woman to graduate from Yale with a PhD in mathematics. In 1947 on the 9th of September, 
                    she recorded the first computer bug after she and her colleagues at Harvard opened up some hardware to discover what was causing the errors. 
                    Unlike the bugs we face today, it was an actual bug, a moth. We celebrate Tester day on the 9th of September to mark this great discovery.</p>

                <h3>Annie Easley</h3>
                <p>Was a computer scientist and mathematician who became a NASA rocket scientist. A groundbreaker for gender and racial diversity, 
                    and when hired, she was one of only four black employees at the lab. Her development work on the software for the Centaur rocket 
                    has been used in a number of NASA missions. Throughout her career, she participated in many outreach programs and broke down many barriers by becoming 
                    addan Equal Employment Opportunity counsellor.</p>

                <h3>Radia Perlman</h3>
                <p>Is a computer scientist and network engineer who is famous for her invention of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), 
                    a technology that helps to prevent network loops and ensure reliable data transmission in computer networks. 
                    Her revolutionary work has been an essential component of our modern computer networks. Currently holds over 100 issued patents and many 
                    prestigious awards and works today for Dell EMC.</p>

                <p>Is an American lawyer, activist, and politician best known for founding Girls Who Code and the Marshall Plan for Moms. 
                    Her non-profit organisations aim to close the gender gap in technology by providing opportunities for girls to learn coding and computer science 
                    and advocate for policies that value women's work in and out of the home. Her work has taught over 300,000 girls to code and reached over 14 billion 
                    online engagements through the girls who code movement.</p>

                <p>Five years ago, she discovered her love for coding after she built a custom add-to-quote feature for her employer's website. 
                    Now, she's on her journey to become a developer. With the help of funding provided by the Welsh government, she began her Level 5 Diploma in Web Application 
                    and Development through code institute in late February 2023. She helped contridute this site, thanks to her awesome hackathon team. </p>
