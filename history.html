    <h1>The Untold History Of Women In Tech</h1>
    <p>Our history is rooted in the incredible achievements of women in tech, from Ada Lovelace and Hedy Lamarr to Grace
      Hopper,
      Annie Easley, and Ladia Perlman. These women have made significant contributions to the industry, and their
      legacies continue to inspire us today.
      We are proud to celebrate and honour the achievements of women in tech, both past and present. Join us in
      discovering more about these amazing women,
      and help us share their stories.</p>

              <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
            <p>Was a 19th-century mathematician who was the world's first computer programmer.
              She wrote the first algorithm designed to be processed by a machine and published it in 1843.
              She is celebrated today as a pioneering figure in computer science and a role model for women in Tech.
              She even has an Ada Lovelace Day designated as the second Tuesday of October.</p>

              <h3>Hedy Lamar</h3>
              <p>Was an Austrian-born actress and inventor, during World War II in 1941, she and co-inventor, Goerge Antheil,
                developed a frequency-hopping system. Originally intended to help guide torpedos without being detected by the
                enemy.
                It took decades for her revolutionary technology to be fully embraced, but it's inspired the WiFi, Bluetooth
                and Gps technologies we use today.</p>

              <h3>Grace Hopper</h3>
              <p>Was a trailblazer in computer science and a pioneer in the development of modern technology.
                She was also the first woman to graduate from Yale with a PhD in mathematics. In 1947 on the 9th of September,
                she recorded the first computer bug after she and her colleagues at Harvard opened up some hardware to
                discover what was causing the errors.
                Unlike the bugs we face today, it was an actual bug, a moth. We celebrate Tester day on the 9th of September
                to mark this great discovery.</p>

              <h3>Annie Easley</h3>
              <p>Was a computer scientist and mathematician who became a NASA rocket scientist. A groundbreaker for gender and
                racial diversity,
                and when hired, she was one of only four black employees at the lab. Her development work on the software for
                the Centaur rocket
                has been used in a number of NASA missions. Throughout her career, she participated in many outreach programs
                and broke down many barriers by becoming
                addan Equal Employment Opportunity counsellor.</p>

                a technology that helps to prevent network loops and ensure reliable data transmission in computer networks.
                Her revolutionary work has been an essential component of our modern computer networks. Currently holds over
                100 issued patents and many
                prestigious awards and works today for Dell EMC.</p>

              <p>Five years ago, she discovered her love for coding after she built a custom add-to-quote feature for her
                employer's website.
                Now, she's on her journey to become a developer. With the help of funding provided by the Welsh government,
                she began her Level 5 Diploma in Web Application
                and Development through code institute in late February 2023. She helped contridute this site, thanks to her
